      <h5>bad calculator</h5>
      <p> a calculator i made with javascript from a simple tutorial on the interwebs. it has some issues like being able to literally put any code you want and <strong><i>execute it through the calculator itself</i></strong> but nethertheless its
      a calculator, i guess.</p>
